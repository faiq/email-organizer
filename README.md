#Email Organizer 

Email organizer is an email to help me learn some front end best practices. The idea was to make a simple interface for interacting with emails, something similar to trello lists.
This is still a work in progress, so its not quite production ready yet.

Getting it started.

1. clone this project from github `git clone  github.com/faiq/email-organizer` 
2. Install dependencies `npm install && bundle install`
3. Start the application `npm start`
4. Go to http://localhost:3000

Here's a preview of what it looks like (so far)!
